## What the hell is this?
I don't know yet. The idea was a Tech/War style mod pack centered around  [Hbm's Nuclear Tech - Extended Edition](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hbms-nuclear-tech-mod-extended-edition). Still, I have no coding experience* and nowhere near enough mod pack development experience to make something slightly functional let alone fun.

## So what are you trying to make?
Still not sure of what I want to make. As said before the **idea** was for a tech mod pack with PVP/PVE elements more specifically similar to Ryan Not Brian's (formerly known as Creepers Edge) Minecraft war series and mod pack updated to a newer version so the criteria are pretty well cut out.

 - 1.12.2 
 - Forge
 - Optimized
 - Server Friendly 
 - PVP & PVE With balancing 
 - Fully fleshed out questline for new players

The reason for the questline is because of my (and my friends) experience(s). As mentioned above, in small text, I said that I have made very bad mod packs to be played with friends. Sure the content was all there but jumping into a kitchen sink mod pack for the first time and not really having any motivation leaves a bit to be desired 

I've also picked out a couple of mods that will (most likely) be used.

 - [Hbm's NTM Extended editon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hbms-nuclear-tech-mod-extended-edition)
 - [MWC](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modern-warfare-cubed) (modern warfare cubed)
 - [MCheliext](https://twitter.com/mcheliext?lang=en) (Just MCheli updated to 1.12.2)
 - [Fancy Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fancymenu)
 - [Custom Loading Screen](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-loading-screen)
 
I am also toying with the idea of some interface mods like a custom main menu and potentially a custom texture pack. Referring back to the "I made a bad mod pack for people to play" bit, that experience made me understand that UI, and more importantly, UX are some of the most important things to keep people retained. hence why I included Fancy Menu and Custom Loading Screen.

## So where are you going with this?
Honestly while writing all this yap, I realized that I don't even have the plan to move forward with this So nowhere I suppose... 
I will most likely be exploring [Fancy Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fancymenu) and [Custom Loading Screen](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-loading-screen) but more than that, just messing around and seeing what sticks.

if you want to contribute or just think this is cool, star this repo or send me a DM on Discord (@morganic_1). Who knows you might get something out of it.

And yes, If you think the name is inspired by [Supersymmetry](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/supersymmetry) you would be correct. (go check them out)
